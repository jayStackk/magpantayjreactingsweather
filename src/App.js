// was going to use Material UI but didnt have time, MY API got blocked and had to free up time for that
// Bootstrapped! CSS'd 
// Peer reviewed by [ N.Harrison Wilkins ]
// The project was well-designed and pretty simple. All the data shows up, and it is pretty much responsive. Overall did a good job!
// If it doesnt work, It's the API, API might be blocked. Been having issues.
